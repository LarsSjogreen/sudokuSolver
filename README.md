# sudokuSolver

Just playing with node.js a bit. This software solves simple Sudokus but will probably fail if they are harder.

To run the program:
```
> node main.js 
``` 

To run tests:
```
> mocha
```

## Todo
* Write more tests
* Some more Sudokus?
* More heuristics
* Sudoku generator?
* OCR using Tesseract?
